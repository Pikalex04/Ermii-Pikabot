### Other Info
Well, nothing else. The original bot was born for... No reason at all, for joking, but nothing more. And so this port is, except this has some cool functions that got added on request. But nothing else at all, yeah, lol.
It also is pretty optimized in speed and size terms, as it shares some code coming from Snaking Shell Bot and PeekanovEx.
